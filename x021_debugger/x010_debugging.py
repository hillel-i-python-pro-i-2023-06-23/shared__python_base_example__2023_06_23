# You can use "debugger" to get more info about program, while develop it.

# Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as 'bugs')

# You can add "breakpoint".
# For this you can click to the left of the line.
#   Or, use hotkey "Shift+F8".
my_variable = "Hi"

# With breakpoint and debugger program paused BEFORE breakpoint.

next_variable = "Hello"

print(my_variable)

# Make "Right mouse Click" at this script. And select "Debug ..." (with green bug).

# Now you in "Debugger".
# At this place you can see your variables and it values.
#   Also, you can see some extra data. For example - "type". Or inner structure of variable.

# Controls:
#   - Rerun script by "Ctrl+F5". Or by "rounded green arrow"
#   - Resume execution and go to next "breakpoint" (or error) by "F9". Or by "green triangle".
#   - Step over code (Line by line) by "F8". Or by "blue arrow at right angles over white stripe"
#   - Stop execution by "Ctrl+F2". Or by "red square".
# Test another controls if you wish.

# You have tab "Debugger". And tab "Console".
#   In "Console" you can see output of your program and make interaction with it. As in normal execution.

# You can have few active debugger, if you need.

# Thanks to the debugger, you can better understand what's going on in your program.
#   It is a great tool to help you with your research and learning.

# If this available, better to use debugger for debugging. Not "print". Use "print" only for "output".
